## About

It is extremely sad that this incredible editor couldn't achieve its full potential, I was heavily invested on the history of its development and the things it tried to accomplish (like teletype RIP). 

Ultimately Atom it couldn't compete with cloud development environments and more efficient (general purpose) desktop solutions like Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

1. Install [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom)
2. Clone the repo into your atom packages folder
   ```sh
   cd ~/.atom/packages
   git clone https://github.com/DarioArzaba/AtomPaquetePalabras
   cd AtomPaquetePalabras
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

When you activate the plugin through its dedicated shortcut `ctrl-alt-o` a window opens showing information about words in the active buffer of the editor.
